# CleverInsight-Web
The application is build using Flask as backend server

  - Uses SQLAlchemy, postgresql, flask_admin, pandas
  - jinja2 template and flask_admin uses bootstrap3

### How to run

I really love to create virtual environment for each and every projects and supply requirements.txt file for them. This way my system is always fresh and clean.

```sh
# Create a virtual environment for this app
$ virtualenv venv
# Activate the app's virtual environment
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ cd flask-admin-example
# Then install all dependencies using 
# requirements.txt file included with the project
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run and get output csv file
$ python run.py
```

Please try this out and let me know.
### Thank You!!
